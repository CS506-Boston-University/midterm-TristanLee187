# CS506 Midterm

To reproduce the predictions, simply run the `prediction.ipynb` notebook. Note that because a Random Forest is inherently random, the produced submission probably won't be exactly the same each time. They should be mostly the same, though.

`exploration.ipynb` and `exploration_2.ipynb` contain some of the code I used for exploration. It's quite unstructured now.

Note that, in this submission, the training and testing data have been omitted from the `data` folder, for the sake of space. What's left is just the submission file.
